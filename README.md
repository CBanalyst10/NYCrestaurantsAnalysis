# NYCrestaurantsAnalysis

Have you ever wondered about how safe eating at a given restarant was? How about a given neighborhood or kind of cuisine? We'll be exploring health inspection data from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene across the state's five boroughs to answer our question: does it really matter where you eat in the city? For the purpose of this investigation our null hypothesis will be that it does matter in which of the boroughs you eat your food at. I will explore health inspection grades, scores, and their boroughs for my analysis.

# Data Source
The source of my data is New York's Open data platform. Data can be accessed via a Socrata SQL query.

# Analysis

Summary analysis: the most common cuisine of all restaurant types in the boroughs is American, followed by Chinese. Queens majorly favors Chinese above all others.
